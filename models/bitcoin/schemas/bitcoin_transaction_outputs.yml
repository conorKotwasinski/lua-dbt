      Bitcoin transactions are broadcast between peers in a serialized byte format, called raw format. 
      It is this form of a transaction which is SHA256(SHA256()) hashed to create the TXID and, 
      ultimately, the merkle root of a block containing the transactionâ€”making the transaction 
      format part of the consensus rules.
