    description: >
      Transactions are cryptographically signed instructions from accounts. 
      An account will initiate a transaction to update the state of the Ethereum network. 
      The simplest transaction is transferring ETH from one account to another.

      n place of human-readable names, ENS works purely with fixed length 256-bit cryptographic hashes. 
      In order to derive the hash from a name while still preserving its hierarchal properties, 
      a process called Namehash is used. For example, the namehash of 'alice.eth' is 
      0x787192fc5378cc32aa956ddfdedbf26b24e8d78e40109add0eea2c1a012c3dec; this is the representation 
      of names that is used exclusively inside ENS.
