## Local Development

**Note**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment

1. Install dependencies

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a file called `.env` in the root of the directory

```shell
touch .env
```

3. Add necessary environment variables to the file

**Note**: Replace `xxx` with the values found in 1Password. Keep `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` as is.

```text
DBT_PROFILES_DIR=.
CH_PASSWORD=xxx
CH_HOST=xxx
```

4. Source the `.env` file

```shell
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

5. Ensure the credentials work

```shell
dbt debug
```

6. Build all models and run tests before you start developing to ensure everything is working prior to you making
   changes

**Note**: Views will show in test databases instead of production. So if you're building there Ethereum models, the
views will appear in `ethereum_test` instead of `ethereum`.

```shell
dbt build
```

## ðŸš§ DANGER ZONE ðŸš§ Production Build

**Note**: It is highly recommended that you let the CI pipeline handle deployments to production. You should not do this
manually unless you have a compelling reason.

To run or test production views, you need to use the production target defined in the `profiles.yml` file. To do this by
using the `--target`/`-t` flag when calling dbt commands

```shell
dbt build --target prod
dbt build -t prod
```
